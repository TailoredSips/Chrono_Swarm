# Chrono Swarm Performance Tuning

_This document covers optimization strategies for high throughput and low latency._

## Strategies
- Use ARM64-optimized Rust builds
- Tune thread pools and async runtimes
- Optimize database queries and connection pools
- Use efficient serialization formats (e.g., Protobuf)
- Monitor and profile with Prometheus and Grafana

See [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) and [deployment/monitoring/](../deployment/monitoring/).
